* [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) - Both 2.7 and 3.6 versions
* [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))

## Analyzed Networks
* [Darknet Yolo](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) - YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection
* [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) - ZF model

## Purpose
Compare two different types of Neural Networks on image detection.
Both the networks are trained on Pascal VOC set and runs on the same hardware.
They can identify 20 different categories:
* Person
* Animals:
    * Bird
    * Cat
    * Cow
    * Dog
    * Horse
    * Sheep
* Vehicles:
    * Aeroplane
    * Bicycle
    * Boat
    * Bus
    * Car
    * Motorbike
    * Train
* Home Objects:
    * Bottle
    * Chair
    * Dining Table
    * Potted Plant
    * Sofa
    * Tv/Monitor

## Features
### Darknet
* Written in C

### Faster-RCNN
